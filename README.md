# Crushing Bugs

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to put my Javascript knowledge into practice and provide fixes for two bugs found on a Drag and Drop puzzle. Firstly, the puzzle pieces shouldn't overlap. Secondly, when choosing a new puzzle, the pieces should return to their original places.
